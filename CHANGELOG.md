# libDaisy Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

* bootloader: added `System::BootloaderMode::DAISY`, `System::BootloaderMode::DAISY_SKIP_TIMEOUT`, and `System::BootloaderMode::DAISY_INFINITE_TIMEOUT` options to `System::ResetToBootloader` method for better firmware updating flexibility.

### Bug fixes

* bootloader: pins `D0`, `D29` and `D30` are no longer stuck when using the Daisy bootloader

### Migrating

#### Bootloader

* This version of libDaisy and greater will be compatible with any version of the Daisy bootloader, meaning you won't have to update the bootloader on your product if you want the latest changes to libDaisy.
* However, for newer versions of the bootloader, you must use a compatible version of libDaisy.

### Migrating

#### SPI

```c++
// Old
SpiHandle::Result DmaTransmit(uint8_t*            buff,
                              size_t              size,
                              SpiHandle::CallbackFunctionPtr callback,
                              void*               callback_context);
// New
SpiHandle::Result DmaTransmit(uint8_t*                            buff,
                              size_t                              size,

                              SpiHandle::EndCallbackFunctionPtr   end_callback,
                              void*                               callback_context);
// Same for DmaReceive and DmaTransmitAndReceive
```

#### MAX11300

```c++
// Old: MAX11300 takes no template arguments
MAX11300 max11300driver;
// New: MAX11300 takes number of chips as template argument
constexpr size_t num_devices = 4;
MAX11300<num_devices> max11300driver;

// Old: constructor only takes a config struct
max11300driver.Init(config);
// New: constructor takes a DMA buffer situated in non-cached and DMA-accessible memory
MAX11300Types::DmaBuffer DMA_BUFFER_MEM_SECTION max11300DmaBuffer;
max11300driver.Init(config, &max11300DmaBuffer);

// Old: most types are inside the MAX11300 classname scope
daisy::MAX11300::PIN_0
daisy::MAX11300::AdcVoltageRange
// New: types are in a separate namespace to keep them independent from the "num_devices" template argument
daisy::MAX11300Types::PIN_0
daisy::MAX11300Types::AdcVoltageRange

// Old: only a single chip was handled by the driver
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogRead(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_0, daisy::MAX11300::AdcVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogWrite(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_1, daisy::MAX11300::DacVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
// New: each function now takes an additional argument, the index of the chip
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogRead(0, daisy::MAX11300Types::PIN_0, daisy::MAX11300Types::AdcVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogWrite(1, daisy::MAX11300Types::PIN_1, daisy::MAX11300Types::DacVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);

// Old: Update() synchronously updates the chip and blocks until the update is complete
max11300driver.Update(); // blocks
// New: - Start() works asynchronously in the background using DMA
//      - Start() will retrigger updates itself automatically, until stopped by calling Stop()
//      - A callback can be called after each update cycle that was completed successfully
void MyUpdateCompleteCallback(void* context) {
    // The context is the pointer you passed when calling `.Update()`
    // This callback comes from an interrupt, keep is fast.
}
max11300driver.Start(
    &MyUpdateCompleteCallback, // or nullptr if you don't need a callback. default: nullptr
    &someThingThatYouWantToGetPassedToYourCallback // callback context, or nullptr if not needed
);
// you don't have to specify the arguments, then the defaults will be used
max11300driver.Start();
// you can stop the auto update after you started it
max11300driver.Stop();
```

## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* driver: added support for the 0 .. 2.5V ADC range to MAX11300, splitting the `enum VoltageRange` into two enums for the ADC and DAC configurations.

### Features

* driver: added support for the MCP23x17 I/O Expander with I2C transport implementation

### Bug Fixes

* usb: fixed bug where using FatFS and a USB Device class simultaneously would result in a linker error.
  * Shared IRQHandlers for the USB HS peripheral have been moved to sys/system.cpp
* driver: made MAX11300 getter functions `const`
* cmake: changed optimization to `-O0` for Debug builds
* qspi: fixed bug causing one sector erase beyond the given end address

### Other

### Migrating

#### MAX11300

```c++
// Old: Same enum used for DAC and ADC configurations
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogRead(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_0, daisy::MAX11300::VoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogWrite(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_1, daisy::MAX11300::VoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);

// New: Different enum used for DAC and ADC configurations
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogRead(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_0, daisy::MAX11300::AdcVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
max11300driver.ConfigurePinAsAnalogWrite(daisy::MAX11300::PIN_1, daisy::MAX11300::DacVoltageRange::NEGATIVE_5_TO_5);
```

## v3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* fatfs: the `dsy_fatfs_init()` function has been replaced with the `FatFSInterface` class that allows for multi-volume filesystem use with SDMMC and/or USB drives.
  * The previous global variables `SDPath`, `SDFatFS`, `SDFile`, and `retSD` have been removed as they could not be used effectively with the addition of multi-volume support.
  * The path, and FATFS objects can be acquired from the new `FatFSInteface` objects, and any `FIL` object(s) can be placed in AXI SRAM (or any other memory with USB).
* namespace: new namespace "seed" was added for new pinout Daisy Seed pinout mappings.
  * This isn't a breaking change on it's own, but when `using namespace seed;` a variable cannot be named, `seed` else it will throw ambiguity errors.

### Features

* bootloader: the bootloader can now be flashed directly from libDaisy using `make program-boot`
  * apps can be built by overwriting `LDSCRIPT` with one of the new (\_sram.lds, or \_qspi.lds) linker scripts, and adding `-DBOOT_APP` to the `C_DEFS` within the user makefile.
  * once the bootloader is on the device, apps compiled with the above changes can be flashed to the bootloader using `make program-app`
  * this process is subject to change, and will be improved and documented in the coming weeks.
* driver: added support for the MAX11300 ADC/DAC/GPI/GPO device
* usb_midi: added `MidiUsbTransport` class for easy usb midi functionality via `MidiUsbHandler`
* ui: addition of `CanvasDescriptor::screenSaverTimeout` setting turns off display after as many milliseconds. Useful for preventing screen burn-in on sensitive displays like OLEDs.
* usb_host: basic support for Mass Storage USB host class has been added.
* fatfs: interface has been reworked, and now supports mounting SDMMC, and/or USB drives. Multi-volume usage with simultaneous use of both is supported.
* core: added new C++ `Pin` type that is constexpr friendly, and backwards compatible with existing C-style `dsy_gpio_pin` type.
  * the old, `dsy_gpio_pin` and it's accompanying functions should no longer be used, and will be removed in a later version of the library.
* gpio: added new C++ API for access to GPIO
  * the old, `dsy_gpio` and it's accompanying functions should no longer be used, and will be removed in a later version of the library.
* seed: new pinout consts have been added using the new type. This is to simplify addressing pins on Daisy Seed, and the names are shared with the Arduino Integration.
  * These constants live in the `daisy::seed` namespace.
  * Digital pins D0-D30 have been added, these return the equivalent pin as `DaisySeed::GetPin(int pinno)`
  * Analog pins A0-A11 map to the ADC accessible pins labeled as "ADCn" in the pinout diagram.
  * The `Ax` analog pin constants can be used when using digital functions, and vice-versa.

### Bug fixes

* patch_sm: corrected the order of the gate out pins
* sai: fixed occasional output audio channel swap (#268)
* sd_diskio: removed extraneous strobing of unrelated GPIO pin
* patch: fixed seed1.1 compatibility to properly initialize the primary codec due to special 4-channel audio

### Other

* switch: Use `System::GetNow()` rather than the update rate to calculate `TimeHeldMs()`.
  * This has also been applied to the `Encoder` class (since it uses `Switch` internally).
* usb host: ST Middleware for USB Host support has been added to the Middlewares folder
* fatfs: changed default `FS_LOCK` to 0, allowing for more simultaneously open FIL objects.
* seed: the contents of `DaisySeed::Configure()` have been moved into the `DaisySeed::Init()` function, leaving it empty. This function can now be omitted.
  * the function was left in place to preserve backwards compatibility, and will be removed in a future version.

### Migrating

* switch/encoder: Backwards compatability for Initializing switches/encoders will be maintained until the next breaking change, at which point the `update_rate` argument will be removed from `Switch::Init`, and `Encoder::Init`.
* fatfs: If file locking was being used, `FS_LOCK` will have to be changed back to a non-zero, positive value.

#### FatFS

Existing code using SDMMC for FatFS only requires a small change to replace the previous `dsy_fatfs_init()` function:

```c++
FatFSInterface fsi;

int main(void) {
  // Daisy, SDMMC, etc. initialization unchanged
  // before:
  dsy_fatfs_init();
  . . .
  // now:
  fsi.Init(FatFSInterface::Config::MEDIA_SD);

  // and instead of the global FATFS object you can now:
  FATFS& fs = fsi.GetSDFileSystem();

  // and instead of the global SDPath object you can now:
  const char* rootpath = fsi.GetSDPath();

  // and then file system works as usual now
  f_mount(&fs, rootpath, 1);
  . . .
}
```

#### GPIO

The new `GPIO` class, and `Pin` type have been added to replace the previous C versions.

The C versions will remain in place for some time to support backwards compatibility, and give people time to migrate.

To make this easier, the new `Pin` type can be automatically converted to the old, `dsy_gpio_pin` to use with classes that have not been updated yet (like Switch, Encoder, etc.)

Here's an example comparing the new and old versions of dealing with GPIO (only one of the many initialization methods is shown here):

```c++
//////////////////////////////////////////
// Initialization:
//////////////////////////////////////////
// Old:
dsy_gpio_pin pa1 = {DSY_GPIOA, 1};
dsy_gpio gpio1;
gpio1.mode = DSY_GPIO_OUTPUT_PP;
gpio1.pull = DSY_GPIO_NOPULL;
gpio1.pin = pa1;
dsy_gpio_init(&gpio1);

// New:
Pin pa1 = Pin(PORTA, 1);
GPIO gpio1;
gpio1.Init(pa1, GPIO::Mode::OUTPUT, GPIO::Pull::NOPULL);

//////////////////////////////////////////
// Read
//////////////////////////////////////////
// Old:
uint8_t state = dsy_gpio_read(&gpio1);
// New:
bool state = gpio1.Read();

//////////////////////////////////////////
// Write
//////////////////////////////////////////
// Old:
dsy_gpio_write(&gpio1, 1); // HIGH
dsy_gpio_write(&gpio1, 0); // LOW
// New:
gpio1.Write(true); // HIGH
gpio1.Write(false); // LOW

//////////////////////////////////////////
// Toggle
//////////////////////////////////////////
// Old:
dsy_gpio_toggle(&gpio1);
// New:
gpio1.Toggle();
```

## v2.0.1

### Migrating

#### QSPI

```c++
DaisySeed hw;
// ...

// Old
hw.qspi_handle.mode = DSY_QSPI_MODE_INDIRECT_POLLING;
dsy_qspi_init(&hw.qspi_handle);
dsy_qspi_erase(address, address + sector_size);
dsy_qspi_write(address, size, (uint8_t*)&some_data);

// New -- qspi mode is automatically handled
hw.qspi.Erase(address, address + sector_size);
hw.qspi.Write(address, size, (uint8_t*)&some_data);
```

#### Sdram

This is only applicable if you had a seed-level board that needed to initialize external SDRAM.

```cpp
//Init
//Old:
dsy_gpio_pin *pin_group;
dsy_sdram_handle sdram_handle;
sdram_handle.state             = DSY_SDRAM_STATE_ENABLE;
pin_group                      = sdram_handle.pin_config;
pin_group[DSY_SDRAM_PIN_SDNWE] = dsy_pin(DSY_GPIOH, 5);

```

## v0.1.0

Initial Release
