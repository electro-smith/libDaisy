/** Audio Recording Module
 ** 
 ** Record audio into a working buffer that is gradually written to a WAV file on an SD Card. 
 **
 ** Recordings are made with floating point input, and will be converted to the 
 ** specified bits per sample internally 
 **
 ** For now only 16-bit and 32-bit (signed int) formats are supported
 ** f32 and s24 formats will be added next
 **
 ** The transfer size determines the amount of internal memory used, and can have an
 ** effect on the performance of the streaming behavior of the WavWriter.
 ** Memory use can be calculated as: (2 * transfer_size) bytes
 ** Performance optimal with sizes: 16384, 32768
 ** 
 ** To use:
 ** 1. Create a WavWriter<size> object (e.g. WavWriter<32768> writer)
 ** 2. Configure the settings as desired by creating a WavWriter<32768>::Config struct and setting the settings.
 ** 3. Initialize the object with the configuration struct.
 ** 4. Open a new file for writing with: writer.OpenFile("FileName.wav")
 ** 5. Write to it within your audio callback using: writer.Sample(value)
 ** 6. Fill the Wav File on the SD Card with data from your main loop by running: writer.Write()
 ** 7. When finished with the recording finalize, and close the file with: writer.SaveFile();
